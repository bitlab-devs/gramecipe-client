# Code of conduct

To make your comtributed code meet our requirements.. you'll have to check our code of conduct.

### Guidelines:

- **Semantic Elements:** A more semantic HTML elements are expected on each components of the React app.

- **Styles:** Stylings are done with ***Tailwindcss*** or ***Vanilla CSS/Pure CSS***. NO custom CSS code should be written on the [index.css](./src/index.css) file, that's where the Tailwindcss is integrated, rather all custom CSS codes should be written in [App.css](./src/App.css).
